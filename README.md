# resolver
POC for a resolver breakout for OLM

* First commmit: 
The first commit includes the resolver package, but still relies on OLM components

* Next Step: 
Next we will show OLM using this new package that is separate of OLM, but still reliant.

* End Goal: 
Pending how the POC goes, we eventually want to remove dependencies of OLM entirely and also make it more abstract to what it can resolve.
